# 3D-Hashin-with-Exponential-Damage-Evolution

In order to effectively describe the progressive intralaminar and interlaminar damage for FRP composite laminates, a three-dimensional progressive damage model for composite laminates to be used for low-velocity impact is presented. it is based on continuum damage mechanics (CDM) and was developed and implemented in the VUMAT user subroutine of ABAQUS/Explicit.

The nonlinear damage model can be used to analyze the dynamic performance of the composite structure and its failure behavior. For the intralaminar damage, as a function of the energy release rate, the damage model in an exponential function can describe the progressive development of the damage. The VUMAT subroutine is validated by well-known papers and can be used in any simulation.
